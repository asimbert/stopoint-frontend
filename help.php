       <p>Having an account with Stopoint is a convenient and easy way to  track your transactions.<br>
  The simplest way to set up an account with Stopoint is to create  a transaction - or in other words -sell a device to us on www.Stopoint.com,  it's easy! &nbsp;You will begin by finding your item, and getting a quote.<br>
  As you take the steps to lock in the offer on your item, you  will be asked for the information needed to create an account. This will  include your address, contact information, and payment preferences.&nbsp; As  always, there is no cost to using Stopoint to trade in your device, and never  an obligation to send the item to us.<br>
  After you create the transaction it can take up to 10 minutes  for our system to process the new account. &nbsp;From there we will send you an  activation email, along with (packing slip and shipping label - .HTML).&nbsp;  We will then request that you follow the activation link and confirm your  account.&nbsp;<br>
  If you have any trouble activating your account, please contact  us immediately through our live chat&nbsp;or ask a question&nbsp;using Contact  us.&nbsp; Activation prevents any downtime in communication regarding important  account and transaction updates that&nbsp;can relate to your inspection and  payment.</p>

  We use CheckMEND, a state-of-the-art tool that includes  information from carriers, law enforcement and insurance companies to identify  whether a device has been reported either lost or stolen.<br>
  CheckMEND is a cutting-edge tool designed to more accurately  detect potentially stolen goods, including smartphones, tablets and computers.  Developed by Recipero, the largest U.S. consumer electronics background report  service, CheckMEND compiles data from major wireless carriers, law enforcement  and insurance companies across the country (including the FBI) to provide the  most complete database of lost or stolen devices. </p>
<p>We also regularly assist law enforcement in the investigation of  stolen property.&nbsp;<strong>We record the device's electronic serial number</strong>&nbsp;for  each item we receive, so we can provide a trail for items under inquiry. Also,  all devices, regardless of whether they are reported as lost or stolen, go  through our data wipe process.</p>
As part of our online  trade-in process, each of our&nbsp;<strong>customers are required to contractually  confirm the device is in fact theirs</strong>&nbsp;<strong>to sell</strong>&nbsp;and has not  been reported as lost or stolen. We also remind customers in the process that  we do not accept items that have been reported lost or stolen.<p></p>

  We always try to identify the owner of any lost or stolen device  we find. &nbsp; If your phone has been lost or potentially stolen, make sure  you report the incident to your service provider and or local police as they  can prohibit the item from being activated by a new user.<br>
  Most phones can be remotely locked and erased to keep your information  safe, you may even be able to put a message on the lock screen with a contact  number in case your phone is located.<br>
  With iPhones for example you can use the Find My iPhone feature  if it has been enabled. With this tool you can lock the device and provide a  phone number on the screen.<br>
  When we receive an item that has been locked and has contact  information we use that information to contact the owner and initiate a  return.&nbsp;For your protection we&nbsp;will require information to verify  that you are in fact the&nbsp;rightful owner of the device. Once that has been  confirmed, we will return your lost property free of charge!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

       <p>An ESN is an Electronic Serial Number. An ESN can also be  referred to as an "MEID or "IMEI.” It is a unique identifier used by  wireless carriers to connect a phone to an account. An ESN will be considered  'bad' if:<br>
  The phone is still active on the account&nbsp;(receiving calls  and text messages, etc...)&nbsp;<br>
  The wireless account has an outstanding balance&nbsp;<br>
  The phone has been reported lost or stolen<br>
  If your buyer receives your device and finds that it has an  active ESN, they will contact you via email to request that you fix the issue  with your wireless carrier. You'll have 5 days resolve the issue.<br>
  If you are unable to clear the ESN, your buyer will consider  your device damaged and offer you a lower price, which you can accept or  decline. (If you decline the new offer, they'll mail your device back to you  within 2 business days.)<br>
  If you are unsure about your phone's ESN, please contact your  wireless provider to find out if it's clear to be activated by a new  user.&nbsp;<br>

         <p>Typically it can take as much as 8 business days (10 - 12  calendar days) from the time you mail your device to the time you receive  payment. &nbsp;This all depends on the time of year, the payment method you  requested and where you live.<br>
  After you receive notification that your device<strong>&nbsp;has been  inspected,</strong>&nbsp;you can expect the following time-frames to receive  payment:<br>
  <strong>Checks</strong>&nbsp;typically take&nbsp;<strong>3 to 5 business days</strong>&nbsp;to  arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;This timeframe quote is provided to us by  USPS.&nbsp;If&nbsp;it's been more than 14 days since you received the email  notification that your check has been sent, please contact us, and we will be  happy to look into it for you.<br>
  You can track your check by logging into your Stopoint account  or via the&nbsp;"Track Offer"&nbsp;link at the top of our homepage.  From there you can click the&nbsp;"Track Payment"&nbsp;link to see  the current location of your check. Please note that the tracking system simply  provides a scan of the last United States Post Office location and will not  provide a delivery date.<br>
  <strong>Paypal payments&nbsp;</strong>it should take no longer then&nbsp;<strong>24 hours</strong>&nbsp;to  arrive. If you have not received the funds it is most likely due to your  account not being verified or being able to accept transfers. Please contact  PayPal customer support to resolve any issues with your account. You can also  request a change in payment address or payment method if you are having  difficulties with your PayPal account.<br>
  Please Note:&nbsp;If you sent us more than one item, payments  are issued per item, not per box. We do our best to consolidate payments into a  lump sum, but because different items move through our evaluation process at  different speeds, you may receive multiple payments if you had more than one  item in your box.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Shipping time to our facility (3-5 business days) &nbsp;We are  centrally located in&nbsp;Miami, Florida You can track your package by logging  into the "Track Order" page on www.Stopoint.com</li>

<p>The best way to prevent delays is to make sure your package is scanned at the post office or FedEx facility for proper shipping, and then watch your email inbox carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend checking your email  daily to avoid any miscommunication. (Check your spam folder if you don't see an update from us)<br>

        <p>Unlocking your iPhone from the AT&amp;T network is an easy (and free!) way to increase the amount of your Stopoint offer by allowing your iPhone to work on other networks. Most AT&amp;T customers are eligible to unlock their old phone after upgrading, but a full list of requirements is available here.  For answers to common questions, see our complete carrier unlocking FAQ.<br>
  It only takes a minute to get started:<br>
  3.	Go the AT&amp;T Device Unlock website (AT&amp;T Business Customers call 1-800-331-0500 to complete the process.)<br>
  4.	Select the checkbox and click the "Agree" button at the bottom to confirm you've reviewed the requirements. <br>
  5.	Fill out and submit the form using the account-holders information.           <br>
  What happens next? <br>
  You should receive an email from AT&amp;T within 5 business days with further instructions.  You can also check the status of your unlock request here. <br>
  Once your unlock request is approved, use iTunes to Backup and Restore your iPhonebefore shipping your iPhone to Stopoint.<br>
  If AT&amp;T denies your request, it may be necessary to resubmit your request or contact AT&amp;T Support for further assistance (please note: if you're recently upgraded, you may be required to wait 14 days.)  If you are not eligible to unlock your iPhone, Stopoint will still purchase your iPhone at our lower, "locked" offer price.</p>

  <strong>Please Note:</strong>&nbsp;A device that is reported active, lost or stolen is the  result of the carrier telling us it is in that status.<br>

  IMEI<strong>&nbsp;(I</strong>nternational<strong>&nbsp;M</strong>obile<strong>&nbsp;E</strong>quipment<strong>&nbsp;I</strong>dentity<strong>)</strong><br>
  An MEID&nbsp;and ESN uniquely identify a CDMA cellphone. In the  2005 time frame, the MEID began to replace the 32-bit ESN.&nbsp;<br>
  An IMEI (<strong>I</strong>nternational&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>obile&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>quipment&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>dentity)  is unique number assigned to a GSM, UMTS or IDEN cellphones.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>An ESN, IMEI or MEID&nbsp;may be active for the following  reasons:</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>The device&nbsp;still holds  an&nbsp;"Active"&nbsp;account status with the carrier&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The account associated with the device has an&nbsp;outstanding  balance</li>
    <li>The device has been reported as&nbsp;lost or stolen</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>If the ESN is not clear for activation, we will notify you via  email and&nbsp;<strong>hold the item for 5 days</strong>. You must tell us if you are  going to clear the Active account, or Accept or Decline the revised offer.<br>
  <strong>To clear and active number</strong>,&nbsp;you must&nbsp;contact your  wireless service provider and clear any issues that are causing your item's ESN  to be active so that we can complete the evaluation process.</p>
<p><strong>After 5 days</strong>,&nbsp;we will issue a revised value for your phone in  "parts only" condition.&nbsp; If you tell us you are going to try and  clear the account, you will have another 5 days to decide if you would like to  Accept or Decline the revised offer.<br>
  If you do not notify us we will automatically accept the revised  offer and pay you the revised offer amount. &nbsp;<strong>PLEASE NOTE: Once you are  paid it is unlikely we will be able to find your phone and return it to you.</strong><br>
  Helpful Hint -&nbsp;You may need this number as a  reference.&nbsp; On many phones you can find your ESN, MEID or IMEI by typing  in *#06# and your phone and the number will appear on your screen.<br>
  Verizon&nbsp;phones can now be checked through their "<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=serviceOnly&amp;action=enterEsn">Activate Phone or Device</a>" page.&nbsp;  For other carriers you may chose their Chat function on their Customer Service  page.</p>

        <p>We understand that it can be a surprise when you get a change in  your offer. &nbsp;If you think we got it wrong you can do the following:<br>
  <strong>Request a reinspection</strong>&nbsp;- To&nbsp;request a re-inspection you can select the link  in the email you received and we will issue a request with our processing  center to re-inspect the phone.<br>
  <strong>To ask us a question about our revised offer</strong>&nbsp;- You can  use&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="#">Live Chat</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="contact">Contact us</a> form. &nbsp;If we  can't explain why the offer changed in more detail than explained in the email  you received, we will have our Inspections Management Team take a closer look  for you. &nbsp;Every so often an inspector may miss something, and  we&nbsp;may&nbsp;adjust or overturn an inspection result and bring your offer  back up.&nbsp; During this time, we would request that you do not Accept or  Decline the revised offer, as this will cancel the re-inspection request.<br>
  <strong>Why things change</strong>&nbsp;- Sometimes we find things you might not know about. While  you may think your phone looks and works perfectly,&nbsp;a functional or  condition rating related defect, or if the item is a different model, we will  calculate a new offer. &nbsp;Once we send you an offer adjustment email you  will have&nbsp;<strong>5 days</strong>&nbsp;to decide if you would like to "<strong>Accept"  or "Decline"</strong>. &nbsp;<strong>If we do not hear from you </strong>after&nbsp;5  days passes, we have to assume you do not object to the new offer, and your  device will be <strong>automatically processed</strong>&nbsp;under the new amount.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;If  you Decline</strong>&nbsp;the offer within the 5 days, the item will be&nbsp;<strong>sent  back to you - Free of charge!</strong><br>
  <strong>How to stay on top of your offer progress</strong>&nbsp;- The most  reliable way you can manage your transactions is through the&nbsp;<strong>"Track  Offers"</strong>&nbsp;page on&nbsp;<a href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>">www.Stopoint.com</a>.&nbsp; Once logged in, you can review  the status of each transaction individually and submit any decision we might  need from you to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you submit a "Decline"  decision, we will return the device to you within 3 business days.&nbsp; You  will receive an email with a tracking number, which will allow you to prepare  for the item's delivery.&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>NOTE:&nbsp; Return packages are not insured against loss or  theft and do not require a signature.&nbsp; We strongly recommend that you  monitor the tracking, and are present for the return delivery.</strong> <br>
  We recommend checking the&nbsp;<strong>"Track Offers"</strong>&nbsp;page  daily after you ship the package to us.&nbsp; The 5 days following receipt of  your item are VERY IMPORTANT, and we are dedicated to making the transaction  seamless so you can get your money FAST if you choose to "Accept" the  revised offer<strong> </strong></p>

          <p>We are constantly looking at the markets and competition to offer the best price, and to provide the most reliable, easy service when trading in a device.<br>
To calculate a competitive offer for your item, we have invested in patent pending tools that use data like market demand, business costs and available inventory to determine a competitive market value.<br>
Additionally, there are a few things you should consider when deciding if selling to Stopoint is the right choice for you.<br>
1. Listings made easy:  If you choose on-line marketplaces like EBAY or Amazon, taking pictures, composing descriptions, managing online accounts, shipping your items, and providing a return for postings can be a pain - and they can cost money.  As well, most marketplaces charge a fee.  With Stopoint, you just need to answer a few quick questions to receive an offer and once you send your device in - your payment is on it's way!<br>
2. Competitive Pricing: We are very competitive with our offers. While other companies might pay more for certain items, we do not charge for shipping - they might, we send you a free shipping label - they typically don't. <br>
3. Safe and Secure Payment:  Instead of waiting to find a seller, we will pay you fast after a quick inspection process has confirmed the condition of the item. Simply select your preferred payment method during the checkout process.<br>
4. Risk Free - If our offer doesn't match the original offer because our inspection found something different that outlined in the offer, and you decide to cancel the transaction, we will ship an item back to you - free of charge.  The value we pride ourselves on more than anything is our commitment to providing you with a crazy awesome experience.   We remain confidently in the reCommerce industry. We know we are not the only choice for finding new homes for used electronics, but we encourage you to try out Stopoint.  We know that you will be glad you did.<br></p>

         AT&amp;T Unlocking FAQs - What you want to know! What is an unlocked phone?
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse-s3" class="panel-collapse help collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
     <p>Most iPhones purchased from AT&amp;T are restricted to the AT&amp;T network.  When a phone is unlocked, that means it is no longer restricted to a single network and can be used with any carrier.  This can only be done by having AT&amp;T unlock the phone for you.  In rare cases, phones may be "factory unlocked" which means they were originally made without any restrictions, but these phones typically cost significantly more.  Please note: "unlocking" your phone is not the same as clearing the passwords or data from your phone.  </p>
<p>Why should I unlock my phone if I'm selling it?<br>
  Unlocked phones are more valuable because they can be sold to customers all over the world.  When we can sell phones for more, we increase our offer to you.</p>
<p>Do I have to unlock my phone before sending it to Stopoint?<br>
  No.  However, if we receive a phone that has not been unlocked, you will receive the lower locked price.<br>
  Does it cost anything to unlock?<br>
  Requesting an unlock from your carrier is FREE.<br>
  Is it safe/legal?<br>
  Yes! If you meet your carrier's criteria to unlock your device, it is absolutely ok to do.  Unlocking your phone only affects the network restrictions on that particular device - not your wireless account or personal data.</p>
<p>Am I eligible?<br>
  In most cases, current and former customers are eligible to unlock their phones after completing the contract term or paying for the phone in full. If you have recently upgraded, you may be asked to wait 14 days. Full requirements for AT&amp;T can be found here.<br>
  How long does it take to unlock?<br>
  The AT&amp;T unlock request can be submitted online and should take no more than five minutes to fill out. AT&amp;T may take up to five days to respond, so it is best to get started right away. <br>
</p>
<p>When should I start the process?<br>
  Your Stopoint Offer is locked in for 30 days to allow time for you to unlock your phone before shipping it. It is best to submit your unlock request right away as AT&amp;T can take a few days for AT&amp;T to complete the process. If there is anything that may cause a delay, they will let you know right away. </p>
<p>How do I know if my phone is unlocked?<br>
  AT&amp;T will notify you that your request has been approved. You should connect your iPhone to your computer, backup, and restore to factory settings using iTunes. After that, you should see a message that the phone is unlocked. </p>
<p>What happens if my unlock request is denied?<br>
  We have found that AT&amp;T is not always accurate when they tell people their phone cannot be unlocked. Continue with the submission, and AT&amp;T will review the account and approve the unlock request if you are in fact eligible. You can also use the AT&amp;T Live Chat option to work out any issues with their customer team.<br>

  <li><strong>Turn Off Device Tracking</strong> (i.e. Find My iPhone, Samsung  Reactivation Lock)&nbsp;and remove password</li>
  <li>This can restrict the device to your account and prevent us from  inspecting it.&nbsp; For Apple device, turn it off in the iCloud settings  menu.&nbsp; For Samsung phones, check the Security settings.<a href="help"> More info</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We recommend:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Save Your Data</strong></li>
  <li>Backup your photos and files.&nbsp; If your device has an SD  card, remove it.&nbsp; We will remove all personal data from the device.</li>
  <li><strong>Send Just Your Device</strong></li>
  <li>Please do not send any extra items that you did not submit  online.&nbsp; We cannot pay you for additional items or accessories.</li>
  <li><strong>Charge Your Device</strong></li>

  <li>If you're switching from an Apple device to something else,  deactivate iMessage to ensure you continue to receive message on your new  phone.</li>
  <li>Tap Settings, then Messages, and move the iMessage slider to  OFF.</li>

<p>Please note that we do not accept devices that have been  reported lost or stolen.</p>
<p>Offers are only valid through the expiration date listed in your  email. Devices shipped after this date may receive a revised offer.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>How to erase all of  your iPhone's data and settings</strong><strong> </strong><br>
  Protect your <em>data</em> and personal information; <em>erase</em> all of <em>data</em> and settings before sending your device to Stopoint.&nbsp;  We will still&nbsp;double-check your device to make sure it's been <em>erased</em> once we receive it.&nbsp;<br>
  Before you <em>erase</em> your device, we recommend you&nbsp;make  a backup of your iPhone's <em>data</em>&nbsp;via iCloud or by connecting your  iPhone to the computer you normally sync with.</p>
<p><strong>Here is how you can <em>erase</em> your device before sending it  to Stopoint:</strong> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Tap the settings (gear icon) from  the home screen<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (or whatever page it happens to be  located on your iPhone).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Tap the "General" settings  menu item.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Choose the "Reset": menu  item.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Tap on the "<em>Erase</em> All  Contents and Settings" menu item.</p>
<p><strong>How to <em>erase</em>&nbsp;your&nbsp;device  via iCloud, if it does not power on or after you have shipped it to Stopoint  with iCloud</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Sign in to <a href="http://www.icloud.com/#find">icloud.com/#find</a> with your Apple ID (the one you use  with iCloud), then click Find My iPhone.</li>
  <li>Click All Devices, and then select the device you want to <em>erase</em>.</li>
  <li>In the device's Info window, click <em>Erase</em> [device].&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To <em>erase</em>:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>An iOS device: Enter your Apple ID password. If the device  you're <em>erasing</em> has iOS 7 or later, enter a phone number and message. The  number and message will be displayed on the screen after the device is <em>erased</em>.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>If your device is online, the remote <em>erase</em> begins. A  confirmation email is sent to your Apple ID email address.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your device is offline, the remote <em>erase</em> begins the next  time it's online.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>How do I deactivate  my phone or other device?</strong><strong> </strong><br>
  To <em>deactivate</em> your <em>phone</em> or other device, you must  contact your wireless service provider&nbsp;and clear any issues that are  causing your&nbsp;device to&nbsp;remain active.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  An&nbsp;ESN is an&nbsp;Electronic Serial Number. An ESN may be  active for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The device&nbsp;still holds an&nbsp;"Active" account  status with the carrier&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The account associated with the device has an outstanding  balance</li>
  <li>The device has been reported as lost or stolen</li>
</ol>
<p>Prior to our inspection, we will check to ensure that the ESN  has been <em>deactivated</em>.&nbsp; If the ESN is not clear for activation, we  will notify you via email and hold the item for 5 days.&nbsp; We will ask you  contact your wireless service provider and clear any issues that are causing  your item's ESN to be active so that we can complete the evaluation process.</p>
<p>After&nbsp;this hold period expires, we will issue a revised  value for your <em>phone</em> in "parts only" condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;You  will have another 5 days to decide if you would like to Accept or Decline the  revised offer.<br>
  Verizon&nbsp;<em>phones</em> can now be checked through their  "<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=serviceOnly&amp;action=enterEsn">Activate <em>Phone</em> or Device</a>" page.</p>
<p>This resource will also&nbsp;provide the make and model of the <em>phone</em> which will confirm that you have an accurate quote for the device you are  sending to us.</p>
<p>Once you have <em>deactivated</em> your device, let us know  and&nbsp;we can continue with the inspection process.</p>

       <p></p><p>As long as you use the shipping label provided by Stopoint, in  almost all cases your package will be insured on the way to our facility.<br>
  Here is what you should know:<br>
  <strong>Do not use a DropBox</strong>&nbsp;- We are not able to insure a package against loss if an  item&nbsp;is not handed directly to a FedEx or USPS employee.&nbsp; We request  and strongly suggest that customers do not use a FedEx or USPS Drop Box.&nbsp;  Using a Drop Box of any kind could&nbsp;cause&nbsp;<strong>2-4 weeks of delayed  shipping, and if never recovered, could result in the denial of the Lost in  Shipping claim.</strong><br>
  <strong>Pack your box carefully</strong>&nbsp;- Based on our extensive experience with shipping and  carriers, we highly recommend that customers take the highest care to pack  electronics very carefully. &nbsp;If you are packing your own box, we also  highly recommend&nbsp;<strong>extra secure closure of the package</strong>&nbsp;around  each edge to prevent any potential tampering, water exposure, dust exposure, or  ripping of the box. Shipping carriers will deny a damage claim if the package  is not properly packed.&nbsp; The claim will be denied if the item(s) are  shipped in a flimsy box, or if not enough packing material is used to protect  the contents.&nbsp; If you have any concerns about how well you will be able to  pack an item, or multiple items, we strongly recommend using a packing  service.&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Record the serial number of your device</strong>&nbsp;- We  encourage customers to record the serial numbers of the devices in transit  prior to shipment, or even snap a few photos for your records.&nbsp; If a  damage or loss claim is the only route available in an unexpected situation, it  is very helpful to have this information ready</p>
We will do whatever  we can to help you recover your device or help you with a claim should the  unfortunate happen. &nbsp;<p></p>

        <p>Yes, you should remove your SIM card before sending your device to Stopoint.
Your SIM card stores information that uniquely identifies your phone on a cellular network. By removing your SIM card, you protect your private service-subscriber key and free your phone to be resold on the second-hand market.  On most devices, the SIM card is located under the battery and can easily be ejected.

       <p>iPhone and iPad SIM cards can be a little tricky. If you have an iPhone 2G, 3G, or 3Gs, locate the SIM card tray in the top edge of the casing, between the headphone jack and power button. If you have an iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, 6, 6+ or Android device locate the tray in the right edge of the casing. Gently insert a SIM card removal tool or a straightened paperclip into the pin-sized hole in the SIM card tray. Once you release the catch in bottom of the hole, the SIM tray will eject from the phone body. Remove your card from the tray and reinsert the tray so it is secure and flush with the casing.
