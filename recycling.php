    	 <p>One of the highest forms of recycling is by reusing it. Therefore, our role is to help you upgrade to the latest iPhone, iPad, and more while expanding the use of your last one. You have an important role to play a part in helping keep electronics out of dumping grounds every time you sell something to Stopoint.</p>

		 <p>If you have something that is outdated and outside the scope of what we buy, it is important to make responsible choices and keep your electronics from becoming part of the growing problem of electronic waste.</p>
