         The holidays are a special time of year. The hustle and bustle of Thanksgiving and upcoming Christmas season is exciting for our staff, but we have not forgotten about our loyal customers. Each day of ours is made even more special because of you and your dedicated support.
         <br>
         <br>
         For this holiday season, Stopoint is launching its Give5 program to donate $5 from every sale to charity from November 22nd until December 31st, 2015 to the <a href=" http://www.casimiroglobalfoundation.org/">Casimiro Global Foundation</a> for their <a href="http://www.casimiroglobalfoundation.org/toy-drive/">Thirteenth Annual Toy Drive</a> to provide toys and bring smiles to children in Haiti affected by hurricane Matthew.  We are proud to partner with the <a href=" http://www.casimiroglobalfoundation.org/">Casimiro Global Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization that has organized Toy Drive every year for the past thirteen years and has benefitted children in more than 25 countries throughout Africa, Asia, Americas, Asia and Europe. 
         <br>
         <br>
         As a company who was founded by three visionary Haitian-Americans who immigrated to the US, we feel compelled to do our part to contribute to those in need, especially children in Haiti. Giving back is a part of our DNA at Stopoint, and we will ensure that we will work closely with local Haitian organizations on the ground to make sure the children receive all the toys safely. As part of our social responsibility, we are committed to do our part to give children in Haiti a well-deserved smile.
